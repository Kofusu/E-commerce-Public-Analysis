### Context
This dataset was generously provided by Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. Those merchants are able to sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners. See more on our website: [www.olist.com](www.olist.com)

After a customer purchases the product from Olist Store a seller gets notified to fulfill that order. Once the customer receives the product, or the estimated delivery date is due, the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email where he can give a note for the purchase experience and write down some comments.

### From this dataset we can ask:
1. Why client cancelled his/her order?
2. How much income in a last year?
3. How long usually does product takes to arrive at the customers?
4. How much store average rating, and why customers give bad ratings?
5. What the most category sells?
6. Which city/state the most customers live?
